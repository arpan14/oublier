# Oublier
It is a web application created using Flask, HTML/CSS, SQLLite3 and Twilio REST API (as messaging service) which will help in sending reminders to patients suffering from Amnesia. 

The project was given as a task to be completed in a span of one week and certain criterias as the following had to be met :
1. Create a (basic) web based application where one can set his phone number.  
2. Send an SMS every one hour except at night.  
3. Try resending an SMS if it fails, but retry no more than 5 times. (There is only so much you can do!).  
4. The web application should also log all the failed messages and tell an user for how many hours the application has been running.
